A few notes:

It evidently grabbed some position upon start up, so the position read out must be working.

Things to look for:

	1. sending two commands to the serial port at the same time

		a. step through the position function in AptMotor in
		MotorClassFromAptProtocolConnor.py in debugger mode. While there look for info on the following issues:

            i. There is currently an issue where I don't think the
            motor is actually moving...

            ii. There is also currently an issue where the read position is incorrect
            at startup.
