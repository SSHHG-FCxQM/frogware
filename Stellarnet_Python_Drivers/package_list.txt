Then install the Stellarnet Driver and Software according to their instructions.
The instructions and installation executables are all on their USB drive.
Install lib-usb-filter (also in their USB drive), and install the filter
for the Stellarnet Spectrometer.

Realize that you will have to uninstall and re-install the filter for the
Stellarnet Spectrometer whenever you switch USB ports on the computer.

Install the Apt software for the K-cube from thorlabs.com. Under device manager,
locate the apt device. Right click it, and click on properties. Check the
option to enable its virtual communication port (VCP). Then unplug and re-plug
the apt device into the computer's usb port.

In the Gui_Controller code, change the port variable to be the COM port that
the apt device is connected to. You can see this under COM and LPT ports in
device manager.
