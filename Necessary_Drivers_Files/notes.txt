The OOI_USB2000.cat and OOI_USB2000.inf files need to be added to C:\windows\inf to be automatically discovered as
drivers when the spectrometer is plugged in to the computer via USB. Either that, or you have to go to device manager,
find the USB2000 connection, hit update driver, and set it to search in the directory that contains these two files.

I'm currently running into the problem where it appears that the USB2000's firmware needs to be updated in order
to run on Windows 10. However, I think we should start writing the program first, because we have plenty
of work to do there.
